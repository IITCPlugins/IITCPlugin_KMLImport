# IITCPlugin_KMLImport

This is a IITC (Ingress Intel Total Conversation) Plugin.

Requires Drawtools.
- Replaces "Import" in the `DrawTools Opt` menu  
Here you can now load KML,GPX,TCX,Geojson or DrawTool files
- Adds a "Optimize" for reducing the point count  
Usually imported data is for more detailed as you really need. This will help you to reduce the detail level.
